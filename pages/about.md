My name's Shrey and I write code.

Heres my story. I went to the University of Waterloo and throughout those 5 years I got the opportunity to intern at 6 different companies (known as the co-op program for all you Canadians). My plan going into those internships was to find out what I wanted to do with software.

Pause. WHAT? I didn't just come out the womb gifted with profound intellectual abilities, and start writing software at the age of 3??

Nope. Like every other student I was lost. I mean I liked writing code, but you can build all types of different software, and work in a range of industries. So, I did what I feel like most students fail to do, I worked a variety of software jobs; writing test suites for quality assurance, building frontend apps for banks, writing programs for robots and firmware for microcontrollers. Finally, I landed on writing backend services for startups which I've been doing full-time since I graduated.
