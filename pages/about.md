I mean if you saw the front page you already know I ask a lot of questions &#128517;.

To answer yours about who I am, the names **Shrey** and I'm a **software engineer**.

In the name of professionalism I guess I should share some academic background. I went to the University of Waterloo and throughout those 5 years I did 6 different interships. My plan going into those internships was to find out what I wanted to do with software. 

Pause. WHAT? I didn't just come out the womb knowing what to do and start writing software at the age of 3?! 

Nope. Like every other student I was lost, I mean I liked writing code but with code you can build all types of different software and work in a range of industries. So I did what I feel like most students fail to do, I worked a variety of software jobs; writing test suites for quality assurance, building frontends for banks, writing programs for robots and firmware for microcontrollers, and I landed on writing backend services for startups which I've been doing full-time since I graduated.

This used to be a classic resume website, the ones that every software student makes to show people they know how to code... but then I realized it was boring. And so I converted it into a less boring blog. A place for all the questions I answer, the things I learn and an extra writing credit for english (I'm joking).

If you want to learn more about me you can send me a message on [LinkedIn]({{site.social.linkedin}}) or reach out to me through the [Contact Page](/contact/).

Happy reading!
