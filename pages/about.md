My name's Shrey. I'm the cofounder of [Cleancut.ai]({{site.social.company_link}}), an AI Copilot trained to help video editors.

You want to know my story?

I went to the University of Waterloo and throughout those 5 years I got the opportunity to intern at 6 different companies. My plan going into those internships was to find out what I wanted to do with software.

Like most other students I was lost. I mean I liked writing code, but you can build all types of different software, and work in a range of industries. So, I did what I feel like most students fail to do, I worked a variety of jobs; writing test suites for quality assurance, building frontend apps for banks, writing programs for robots and firmware for microcontrollers. I also worked at companies of varying sizes, from massive corporations to 30 person startups.

I went on to work at Asana as a software engineer. Right about this time a project I had been helping my friend with had been growing traction and I realized I wanted to continue working on it. This project was [Cleancut.ai]({{site.social.company_link}}).

As of now this websites pretty empty, but follow my [Medium Page]({{site.social.medium}}) if you're interested in keeping up with my journey!
